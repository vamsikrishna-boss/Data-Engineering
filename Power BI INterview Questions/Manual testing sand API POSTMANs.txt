
Can you brief interduce you self?

-->Hi my name is vamsikrishna
  
-->iam started my carrier as a testing excutive 1.5 yr of back with mindtree.currently iam working on Test engineer.
	
-->My responsibilities is understand the business requirements specifications and high level scenaris and to convert them into test cases automation scripts 
   if required

((-->Execution of test cases and reporting of defects to the developer if there any get them fixed.i have experience on functional testing and Automation,Regression,Smoke,
   sanity.

  -->In my previous project  i have worked on automation testing where we have Post man for Api testing and test complete using java script.
  
  --> For building management & Test cases management we have used Azure devops.))

(-->Execution of test cases and reporting of defects to the developer if there any get them fixed. i have experience on functional testing and Automation,Regression,Smoke,
   sanity,web analytics and mobile testing.
2
-->In my previous project  i have worked on automation testing where we have selenium with java and TestNG Cucumber frame work for approch BDD. we have page object model 
   where we have separated our testcases with page object. 

-->For building management tool we using Maven for verson controling  we are using Git and for automating our jobs for nighly.

--> for defect management & test case management  we have used  JIRA, Test Rail & HP ALM. )


--> Iam working on Agile management we have daily stand up calls and we have  2- week sprint cycle .iam part of 8-members team out of which we are 3- tester,
    4dev,1 manager,1 scrum master. 

--> Then we have our daily scrum meeting where we used to tell our previous day action what we  did.what we are planning for today  and if we have blockers to discuss
    product owner scrum master help to us resolved that blocker after that i need pending tasks i need to action.
--> whether  creating test cases and execution and defects retesting if any.	
============================================================================================================================================================================
Tell me You day to day activities?

--> First thing i do after login my system. i check active sprint in azure for our project.there i can see my assigned tasks and open tasks. after check my mail any 
    importnat need to take action on. then we have our daily scrum meeting and where we used to tell previous day action and wht we did and what plan today and we 
	have any doubts any blockers discussed with product owner and scrum master help to us resolve our doubts.after that i need to take the pending tasks need to do 
	create test cases and execution and defects retesting if any.
============================================================================================================================================================================
QA Testing Activities/Responsibles?

--> Understanding the Requirement and specifications of the application
--> identifing required test scenario
--> Design test cases valid scenarios
--> Log test results(How many test cases pass/fail)
-->Defect reporting
-->Retest fixed defects
-->Report the test lead abot task status
-->Participated in regular team meetings
-->Creating automation testing for regression testing.
============================================================================================================================================================================
What are the scenarios not automated?

 --> in my experience 
    1. CAPTCHA Scenarios: best way to handle is tell your dev team diable make it static
	2. Video streaming scenarios:Selenium wont be recorganise video controls.
	3. Code reading scenarios: If your web apps is bar codes and qr codes it's not benficial automate it.
	4. Crash recovery scenarios: you might want to testapplication crash recovery.this scenario best for manually.
	5. performance testing: it can be automated but its best not to automate performance testing using selenium.
======================================================================================================================================================================
 What are the challenges faced in selenium?
 
 --> Supports only web bases application: Selenium only automated testing for web based application can't test window based application.
 
 --> Timeout/Synch isssue: Whether the call it a timeout or synch issue.it is the one of the most common challenge in selenium test automation.if you don't issue carefully.
 
 --> No Captcha Handling: With selenium.you can't handle captcha completly. Though there are some third partytools that can help in automation captcha.
 
 --> No Reporting: No doubts selenium can enormosly improve automation testing capabilitybut due to some limitations.it generate good testing reports.
 
 -->Need programming Language support:
 
 -->Windows  Pop-Up:
 
 --> Identifying Dynamic Elements:
 
 --> Cross browser Testing:
 
 --> Mobile apps:
 
 --> Multi tab testing:
 
 -->Scalability:

	==> The project is CSI_EBG_DIGITAL_TRASFORMATION

         CSI is company name.Coputer service INC.
		 EBG it is service
		 Digital transformation is the b2c Business to employee experience.
    
	-> CSI is the leading fintech and financial technology and core banking process and electronic and print distribution and digital banking and payments process and compilence.
	   CSI is the fourthlargest core banking proceess in U.S in 2017. and CSI is raanking IDC financeal insight fintech.
       CSI is recognized by the american banking it's inagurated an list of 20 Best fintech work for us.
       CSI is the High fintech and cyber security operations and interaction and innovation and service.
    
	
	There are bank of america many banks is there.but they want to use OWN authentication. This CSI not only bank OF america this CSI under so many banks ar there.but there are less security.
    Then CSI will ask to Create Identity provider them.
	
    In this Identity Server In this Two things.   
  
     Identity Server: Identity server is the service and in this give platform login to the digital banking.

     Identity Provider: Identity provider means like bank like CSI. they will provide Username and password.
  
     Identity provider will be provide authentication and server it will login.
	 
	 Ex: Instagram page is server and the user name and password you are giving it's a provider. That is called identity provider. 
	 
	 then After creating validate username and password is like. these it will identity provider. the Identity server will check these person give the 
    credentials that credentials write or wrong.
	
	 Mobile user: Once give the credentials after login to the application openid checks and used by authentication. 
	 ==========
	 In this user use the it will ask for username and password once give the credentials after open Id that is protical.that protocol generate one token that is called JWT.
	 
	 You got some doubt? Y this token is generate?
	 
	 iam user you know but Computer don't know so that's why i have access to take some kind of modules in the application.so each user help of the creationg one autherization token.
	 
	 What it will do ?
	  

    It will send the JWT token to the CX who has loged in. that JWT token goes to the FDX Where all API s are storedd.Fdx TOKEN WILL SEND IT VALIDATION. Like RBAC.
    Then it will check auterized API. then Authentication is completed.

    If the Cx wants to check the loans but he doesn't have permission  becz there is no loans are FDX WILL NOT CHECK.LIKE FAILED.

    user is based on the newtwork. employe will go the identity Server and 	open iD connect then will provide the access to user. this is the Overall project.
	
	
	
	B2c customers : like b2c customer is business to customer like this projects are run into B2c packages. like business means provide the authentication and autherization customer a well.
	
	FDX: it is the bi directional communication system. in this two end nodes 1 is that SEND 2. Receive. at the same single carrier and dual communication that is called FDX.
	
	JWT is nothing but JSON Web token.It means some kind of information.

   Https://regres.in/ = Domine
   /api/users = path parameter
   page=2 = Query parameter.

=========================================================================================================================================
==> How to Create the First get request
    click on create collection and
    click on +signin 
    select GET from the dropdown
    Put the api URL
    and hit send
Once we hit the URL we can see the response below body section. we can see the response multiple ways XML,JSON, TEXT,Json,etc..
There are multiple respresentational responses.
=======================================================================================================================================
Parms: Parameter of the request.
Authorization: Login Autheriozation,Token and some api are restrict then that time uses the autheroization.
Headers: receive from the server.
Body: Contain all rresponse.
Pre-req-script: Any request we want to exeute before sending the request.
Test: Most imp and add validation.all otherscripts also this tab.
=========================================================================================================================================
Request payload = We need to send data with our request and its optional
Response payload = We will always get it against any response
=========================================================================================================================================

a; cLICK ON 3 DOTS AND EXPORT IS hson FORMATS
   click on import which is avalible in the infront of work space.
==========================================================================================================================
==> Postman variables?
A: sometimes we need to use same data multiple requests in multiple APIs so we need to create variable to store the data we don't need to write the data again and again.
===========================================================================================================================================>
 What is collection variable?
A: Collection variable is knothing but use inside only collections.

==> Environment variables?
A: Environment variable is knothing but use for all collections.

===================================================================================================================================
==> Types of requests?
A: pre-request: which is run after the code.
   Test: WHICH is run before the code.
====================================================================================================================================
==> What is JSON?
A: JSON is (javascript object Nation). it is light weight process and storing transporting the data. it is used data sent from the sserver ansd web.
====================================================================================================================================
===> What is XML?
A: XML is the stands for Extensible markup language.
   Markup language for documentation containing structured information.
   Used to describes the contents of the document.
   useful in exchanging data between the application.
   Makes data: easy to read, unambiguous, extensible, platform inmdependent.
====================================================================================================================================================   
==> What are challanges faced in API testing?
A: Intial project setup,
   Lack of JSON KNowledge
   API sequencing
   Test coverage,
   Tool selection process.

==> What are basic checkup in API Testing?
A: Verify correct HTTP stsus codes.
   verify response payload,
   verify corrct application statement
===================================================================================================================================================================
--> What is Groovy script?
     the groovy script is used to generate and provide the data into the groovy test request.it is used to verify the groovy response. it can be used for set
     of script property different levels. such as request test step and test case and test suite.
	
==============================================================================================================================================================
==> mention different between POST AND PUT?
     POST: post request is used for creating a resource. it allows client to create resource without knowing the URL of the new resource
     PUT: put request is used for both creating and updating the new object in the data base if resource already exists the put will updsate resource.
===========================================================================================================================================================
 --> what is the protocol do rest API
     REST api uses the HTTP protocol to communicate the clients. this allows REST APIs easily deployed over the internet. since http is the same peotocol that
     is used for web pages.
	 Ex: 

                                                               CORE Java

--> java is a simple programming language
--> it is write code and compilation and debugging very easy
--> and it helps create reusable code.
--> java has a more features.

platform indipendent: During compilation of programs convert into byte.using the byte code and we can run the application anywhere windows,mac,linux,etc..
open soure: a program in which source code is avalible to the general public use and modification from original design of free of cost is called open source.
multithredding: java is a multithredding. it enables a program to perform several task simultaniously.
more secure:it provides the application firevals between the applicationand the computer
portable: write once run anywhere

--> OOPS:(OBJECTED ORIENTED PROGRAMMING Structure)
      It is used to program methodology and program stetargy it is reqired to full fill the project requirement.
       it is used to 4 pillers are there  

 -->CLASS: Class is noting but collection of methods collection of objects
       Syntax: (first type class name and click ctrl +space)
                public class Bank {
                  } 
               //Bank is a class name
               //public: is a access specifier.

 --> METHOD: Set of actions to be performed. 
         Syntax: public void dummy {
                 } // dummy is methos name
           Main
                 public static void main(String[] args) {
                  }
    ->Public: public is a Access modifier it is used to call any method or class by JVM from anywhere.
    ->static: without creating object we are access the Static method
    ->Void: void is return type we can not return the method that time we can use the void
    ->main: main is the name of method
    ->(String[] args): It is used to command line arguments

 --> OBJECT: Run the memory allocation
             using object we call the any method
         Syntax: (Class name)(object name) = new(class name)

 -->Inheridance: it is used to one class to the methods and variabls are the anothere class rewriting is called inheridance.
 -->abstraction: it is used to hiding of unnesssary data.
 -->encapsulation: it is used to secure data (structure of creatingfolders)
 -->polymorphism: one thing multiple behaviour.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
inheritance types:
 1. single level:  one parent class is directly support into one chaild class using extended keyword.
 2. multi level :  one chaild class and morethen one parent class.
 3. hierarchal  :  one parent class and more then one chaild class.
 4. multiple    :  one class inheritance two parent classes at the same time.

     different methods is called method overloading.                    different arguments is called method overriding.

  2.over loading is subselected to single class                       2.over riding is inheritance compulsary.

  3.over loading is change the method signature.                      3.over riding is method signature must be same.

  4.we can change the method hadder over loading.                     4.we can't change the method hadder while overriding.
  
  5.over loading will be achive compile time.                         5.over riding will be achived run time.

  6.over loading is an example of compile time polymorphism.          6.over riding will be example of run time polymorphism

4. c platform dependent                                                4.java is independent
5. c supports pointers                                                 5.java does not suppoerts pointers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 module :2

   method without argument:
  method with arguments is the due to the will never write a logic in side class and write a logic inside main method
  Ex: access specifier static/non-static return type
       {
          body of method
       }

method with arguments:
method without arguments is the due to the area of the rectangle area of square method are multiple times same output is the
method with arguments
Ex: public static void add();

method with return type:
whenever we want to our method return type of the particular valuewith return type.
Ex: public static int()
{
body of the operation
}

method overloading:
it is developing multiple method same different methods is called method over loading.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
51.Variables
   Variables are two types 
   local variables
   global variable
   
 local variable:
 variables are declared inside main method(main() and userdefine)with in the scope of class it is called local variables.
 it access of the inside method not outside method

 global variable:
 global variables are due to the declared outside main method(main() and user define ) with in the class such a variables is called 
 global variables.

 1.static variables
 2.non-static variables
 
 1.static variables:
   Variables which are declared out side in the method with in the class such a variables is called static variable.
  Ex: class ex
        {
        static datatype var=value;
         main();
}

2.Non-static variable:
  variables which are declared outside the method with in the class does't contains such a variables is called non-static variable.
   Ex: class ex
         {
           static datatype var=value;
         }
}

Variables

 variables is used due to the store the data
 it is used to 2 tyoes
1.variable declaration: it is used due to the reserving one block in our own memory.
2.variable intialization: it is used due to the store the value in reserving block.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
52.what is array
A. it is used to collection of data.

   1.static means single copy                                                     1.non-static means doble copy
   2.static members is present static pool                                        2.non-static members present in object.
   3.static members can't be inherited                                            3.non-static members are can be inherited.
   4.static method can't be over ridden                                           4.non-static members can be overroden.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
54.      Constuctor:
   constructor is a special type of method which excuted whenever we created an object.
 Ex: Access modifier constructor name
{
body of the method
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
55. 1.constructor does't have any arguments is called no-argument constructor.
    2.constructor does the any arguments is called paremenant constructor.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
56.constructor chaining:
   the process of one constructor from another constructor is called constructor chaining.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
57.constructor over loading 
 the process of developing  multiple constructor and same constructor name different methods is called 
  constructor over loading.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
58.object class
  object class is the parent class it is predefined class or user defined class.
EX: class A
    {
      public static void main(string args[])
     {
      }
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
59.String class

Ex; public string to string()
{
return package name,class name
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
60. collection and frameworks:
   
   The collection in java  is frame work that provedes store the manupulation of an objects.
 
 frame work:

the it providess readymade architecture
it represents a set of classes and interfaces.

it is collection frame works are the represents unified architecture store the manupulation of group of objects.
classes(arraylist,vector,linked list), interfaces(set,list,deque).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
61. Exception handling
    exception handling is the powerful machanism of the handle run time error and norma;l flow of the exception handling
    Exception handling is abnormal condition.

64.bubble sort
    bubble sort(arr,size)
    for i=0 to n-i-1
    for j=0 to n-i-2

2. abstarct class is final and non-final,static and non-static                                        2.interface is the static and final variables.
3. abstract class is abstract keyword is used declare abstract class.                                 3.the interface keyword is used declare interface.
4.as abstract class can be extended using keyword extends                                             4.an interface can be implemented using keyword"implemets".
