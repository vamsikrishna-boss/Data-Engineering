         CSI is company name.Coputer service INC.
		 EBG it is service
		 Digital transformation is the b2c Business to employee experience.
    
	-> CSI is the leading fintech and financial technology and core banking process and electronic and print distribution and digital banking and payments process and compilence.
	   CSI is the fourthlargest core banking proceess in U.S in 2017. and CSI is raanking IDC financeal insight fintech.
       CSI is recognized by the american banking it's inagurated an list of 20 Best fintech work for us.
       CSI is the High fintech and cyber security operations and interaction and innovation and service.
    
   In this Identity Server In this Two things.   
  
     Identity Server: Identity server is the service and in this give platform login to the digital banking.

     Identity Provider: Identity provider means like bank like CSI. they will provide Username and password.
  
     Identity provider will be provide authentication and server it will login.
	 
	 Ex: Instagram page is server and the user name and password you are giving it's a provider. That is called identity provider.
	 
	 These are 2 users like One is mobile user and second one is the Laptop user.
	 =========
	 Laptop: In this user use the it will ask for username and password after checkin login button. then trying to login wit credentials. then it valid by Open Id.
	 
	 Open ID is a protocol and it is valid Security if incase user credetials is valid.
	  
	 Once give the credentials after login to the application openid checks and used by authentication. 
	 ==========
	 In this user use the it will ask for username and password once give the credentials after open Id that is protical.that protocol generate one token that is called JWT.
	 
	 You got some doubt? Y this token is generate?
	 
	 iam user you know but Computer don't know so that's why i have access to take some kind of modules in the application.so each user help of the creationg one autherization token.
	 
	 What it will do ?
	  
	 That autherization is nothing but some kind of nformation.
	 
	 Once login to the customer then authentication and autherization done User and admin login to the application.Like token is produced from Oauth protocol or FDX.
	 
	 After passing the tokenit will redirect and checks who is the Admin who is the user.
	 
	 Admin is nothing but employee and user is nothing but Cutomer.
	 
	 After login the server will use the Oauth protocol from the Admin. Genaerate the JWT token hit the server.
	 
	 Oauth is knothing but Some part of the Authentication.
	 
	 Server and JWT token some parts of the authentication.
	 
	 ========================
	 If the Customer is the USER.
     
     The Cx is bank of america user.

     These will be two users. first user will do give the username and password directly go through to the authentication.

    Identity server Two types 1. CSI provider   2. Bank provider.

    CSI provider:
    =============

    There are bank of america many banks is there.but they want to use OWN authentication. This CSI not only bank OF america this CSI under so many banks ar there.but there are less security.
    Then CSI will ask to Create Identity provider them. then After creating validate username and password is like. these it will identity provider. the Identity server will check these person give the 
    credentials that credentials write or wrong.

    It will send the JWT token to the CX who has loged in. that JWT token goes to the FDX Where all API s are storedd.Fdx TOKEN WILL SEND IT VALIDATION. Like RBAC.
    Then it will check auterized API. then Authentication is completed.

    If the Cx wants to check the loans but he doesn't have permission  becz there is no loans are FDX WILL NOT CHECK.LIKE FAILED.

    user is based on the newtwork. employe will go the identity Server and 	open iD connect then will provide the access to user. this is the Overall project.

==> Explain Android testing framework?

Android testing framework includes three segments

Application Package: It is the target application that requires to be tested
Instrumentation TestRunner: It is a Test Case runner that runs test cases on target application. 
                             It includes an SDK tools for building test and a tool that provides APIs for writing program that control an android device, for example, MonkeyRunner
Test Package:             It includes two classes, Test case classes, and Mock objects. Test case classes include test methods to perform on target application, 
                            while mock object includes mock data that will be used as sample input for test cases.
							


 Explain what is Robo-electric testing framework?
Testing done on Android Testing Framework for emulators or device is difficult. Running and building test case sometimes takes lots of development effort.
 Robo-electric framework allows you to run Android test directly on JVM without the need of a device or an emulator.							
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================   
==>  List out the best practices for Android Testing?
