========================================================================================================================================================================================
==> What is Power Query?

A: Power Query is nothing but It is ETL(Extract transformation load]
    power query can do extract the data from data source. Like: Excel, CSV, Xml,
    When my data is not proper that time it is used.
    power bi >> Home >> transformation data >> will take power query  editor window.
=========================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between Power Query and Power View , Power Query and Power Pivot ,Power Query and DAX?

A:                      Power Query                                                                                                                                                                   Power View                                                                                                                                                                                                          Power Pivot

   ==> Data Connect and transformation tool. It is used to extract data from data source.                  ==> Interactive data Visualization tool. It is used to create interactive visuals and Dash boards.          ==> Power pivot is nothing data modelling and in-memory analytics. It is used creating data models and relationships.

                             DAX
   ==> It is Data Analysis expression and it is used creating and calculate columns, measures, and custom tables. And collection of functions, operations and that can be used formula, or expression calculate oe or more values.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between Pivot ,Unpivot and Transpose?
A:                                Pivot                                                                                                                   Unpivot                                                                                                                 Transpose

-> Pivot is nothing but it is used convert rows into column.                        -> It is used converted into column into rows.                                 -> It is used nothing but rows into column and column into rows.
==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
==>  How to Identify duplicate and remove duplicate?

A: Select which column you want find out the Duplicate Select the rows and click the dropdown rows after that Unselect all particular option select find out the user id multiple times it is repeated some duplicates are there.
     Select the rows and click the dropdown rows and select all and go to home => Remove columns option there click that option and select remove duplicate option once click on that option
     Automatically remove those duplicates in columns.
	 Dax:
	 Duplicates= If(Countrows(Filter('order','order'[Sales]=EARLIER('order'[sales]))>1,"Duplicate","unique"))
=======================================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between APPEND and MERGE?
A:                                                                                   Append                                                                                                                                                                Merge
       -> Append is nothing but Append the data both table and create separate file.                                                                                         -> it is used merge the two tables.
       -> in the append combined rows from two or more tables.                                                                                                                            -> I t is used combined columns from two or more tables.
       -> Union SQL joins.                                                                                                                                                                                                     -> Similar to SQL joins (left, right, Full, Inner)  
       -> Here is should be common name in a column                                                                                                                                                 -> Here common should be there both tables.
=======================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between Duplicate and Reference?
A:                                                Duplicate                                                                                                                                                                                                              Reference
   -> When we click on the duplicate that time Automatic save the Right side applied steps.                                             -> When We click on the reference that time Applied steps are not copied.
   -> When we Delete column in the main table that time not deleted in the duplicate table.                                            -> When we deleted the column in the main table that time we are delete reference also.
   -> Duplicate Query is not depend main query                                                                                                                              -> Reference Query is based on the main query.
   -> Suppose if we have change in the duplicate table that time not replace in main table.                                               -> While we have change in the reference table that time automatically replace in main table also.
  -> Less efficient as it copies the entire data set.                                                                                                                           -> more efficient as it copies the entire data set.
===========================================================================================================================================================================
==> .Difference Roundup and Round Down?
A:                                            Round Up                                                                                                                                                                                                               Round Down
      -> It is nothing but we have selected decimal column that time click on round up                                                             -> It is nothing but we have selected decimal column that time click on round up
          that particular value convert decimal to normal round value it's showing.                                                                             that particular value convert decimal to normal round value it's showing.
================================================================================================================================================================================
==> What is Manage Parameters?
A: Whenever you want to change the data source Dynamically that time it is used manage parameters.
     For ex: if you want swich from dev to Test and production that time this parameters are going to help us dynamically. Switch dynamically between Environments.
    options >> power query >> paramete>> select the check mark button. That we get the option.
(Ex: we have click on Get data >> Sql server >> Open the SQL Server database >> Server click on New parameter and give the server name in name >>in the current value after Server name >> Click ok
Tab will go to SQL server data base tab After Give the data base name like Data base >> Select Import option >> Click ok Automatically load the data in SQL server.

==> What is modelling?
A: Modelling is nothing but we get the data from multiple tables and connect together and create relationship between two tables that is called data modeling.
=========================================================================================================================================================================
==> Types of relationship?
A:  4-types of Relation ships
      One - to - one
      one - to - many
      Many - to -one
      many - to - many
==========================================================================================================================================================================
==> Cross filter direction and types?
A: Cross Filter is nothing but it is use the data flow one table to another table that is called Cross filter direction.
    There are two types of Cross filter directions.
      (Single and both)
======================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between Dimension table and Fact Table ?
A:                                    Dimension                                                                                                                                                                                                             Fact table
-> Dimension table that can give descriptive information that can slice and dice from the fact                                   -> Fact table is nothing but keep the numeric data and aggregated and reporting visualization.
    table.
-> Dimension table is give detailed information.                                                                                                                      -> Fact table is give numeric values.
-> Dimension table is having primary key.                                                                                                                                  -> Fact table is having foreign key.
-> Dimension table we can see the hierarchy data.                                                                                                                  -> Fact table can't see the hierarchy data.
-> Dimension table less rows.                                                                                                                                                        -> Fact table huge number of rows.
========================================================================================================================================================================================
==>  Difference between Star schema and Snowflake schema ?
A;                                              Star Scheme                                                                                                                                                                                          Snowflake
-> Fact table connecting with multiple table that is called Star Scheme.                                                                            -> Fact table Connecting with dimension table and again dim table connecting with Sub dim to gather that is called Snowflake table.
-> Less tables                                                                                                                                                                                     -> More tables.
-> It reads Data fast.                                                                                                                                                                        -> It reads data Slow.
-> Data transformation (Insert/Update/Delete) Slow.                                                                                                            -> Data transformation (Insert/Update/Delete) Fast.
-> Large amount of data.                                                                                                                                                                -> less amount of data.
=================================================================================================================================================================================================
==> How to handle many to many relationship / How to avoid many to many relationship / Bridge table concept?
A:  When you have handle the relationship that time we have to create separate table and we have to keep unique values that is called bridge table.
      That table we can create relationship between two table avoid many to many relationship.

To avoid the many to many relationship and can I implement bridge table and take unique values and manage the many to many and fact  table and bridge table connect the relationship.
==============================================================================================================================================================================
==>  Is it possible to create more than 1 active relationship between 2 tables?
A: No, it is not possible to create more than one active relationship between two tables in Power BI. 
Each pair of tables can have only one active relationship at a time. However, you can create multiple inactive relationships between the same tables.
==================================================================================================================================================================================
==> How to Make Active Relation as In-Active Relation?
A: When you have relationship in a Dots(…..) That relationship is called In-active relationship. 
     When you have relationship in a Dots(----) That relationship is called active relationship. 
============================================================================================================================================================================================
==> How to make use In-Active relationship ? 
A:  When we have a right click on line and and click on properties after able to see Edit relationship and in that page we can manage the active and in active relationships.

A: Important components of Power BI are: 1) Data Integration, 2) Data Processing, and 3) Data Presentation ============================================================================================================================================================================
==> What are the connections and difference between them?
A:                     Import                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Direct query mode                                                                                                                     Live Connection
=> When you have change the data that time we can refresh and change the data.                                                   => When You have the change the data that time we are using we can't do change.                      ==> When you have power bi model and analysis of the service we are using that live connection mode.
=> Performance wise Import mode is good.                                                                                                                         => Performance wise Direct query mode is not good.
=> When you huge data that time import can't support.                                                                                                   => When you have huge data that time we can support DQM.
=> Import can support all kind of DAX functions.                                                                                                                 => DQM can't all kind of DAX functions.
==> Excel and flag files we are using Import mode                                                                                                              => SQL data base we are using direct query mode.

==================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
==> What are data sources you connected?
A; Mostly we are connected SQL server and Excel.
================================================================================================================================================================================
==> what are charts you used ?, Can you explained about them?
A: Stacked bar chart: It is used due to the display the horizontal bars. Each category represent by a bar. Each segment represent sub-category whole.
     Stacked Column chart: It is used vertically showing the data. And it each category represent by a column and each segments represents sub-category whole.
     Clustered bar chart: It is used due to the display the data horizontally bars and each category represents by a group of bars clustered together and each segment is represents different sub-category or groups.
     Clustered Column chart: It used due to the display the data in the vertical columns. By data represent and vertical bars and clustered to gather and each column represented sub-category or groups.
     Line chart: It is used due to the trend analysis.(we want to 5 months of sales result that time  trend is going to analysis of the data that's why we are using these line chart).
     Waterfall chart: It is used due to the helps understand one value to another value.(Ex: if you have Jan to fep sales changing whether values increasing or decreasing).
     Funnel Chart: It can represents the data stages.
     Scatter chart: It is used due to the two numeric values relation we are going use the Scatter chart.
     Pie chart: When you have use <5 to <10 values that time we are using this pie chart. More than ten values it's showing clumsy.
     Donut chart: It is use the type of pie chart and it is displays each segment and represents the whole and showing different categories. 
     Tree map: It is used due to the data display in the Rectangular boxes left to right displays large boxes high values and small boxes low values.

     Map: These 3-maps are using geo-graphical only. When we want to sales from state wise that time we use this map visuals.
     Filled map: it is used due to the to see the locations tooltips of a data.
     Shape map: it is used to see the location with shape of the countries without latitude and longitude.
     Gauge: Guage is used due to the heighlet the business. This is one of the work like KPI. KPI is nothing but set the target.
     Card: in this card we are using the any data we can se the single value like sales, profit, and quantity.
     Multi-row card: Multiples values are presented in a table we want display that time we are used this visuals.
     Slicers: It is used filter the values in report that time we are used this slicer.
     Table: It is uses the some information in excel sheet how it's showing in excel that same kind of thing we want to see that time this is used.
     Matrix: the matrix table is same pivot table.
     Decomposition tree: it is used to give the route cause analysis of the breaking down the major.
======================================================================================================================================================================
 ==>  Types of filters?
A: It is use the filter the values
     it is 3-types of the filters
Visual level filter: It is used due to the filter the values in particular o specific visual.
Page level filters: It is used due to the apply the filter specific page.
Report level filter: It is used due to the filter the all reports.
===========================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference Between Drill through and Drilldown?
A: Drill Down: It I used due to the it is power full feature of the power bi. User navigates different levels of the data in visuals. That is used due to the analysis purpose only.
     Drill through: It is used due to the user navigate to the one page to another page view more detailed that time we are used drill through
===================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Difference between Filter and Slicer/Sync slicer ?
 A:                             Filter                                                                                                           Slicer                                                                                                     Sync slicer
=>  Filters are is one of the feature in PBI.                                            => Slicers are using one of the visual in PBI.                                          => it is used to feature of the pbi.
=> There is a page level, report level, visual level.                               => Slicers are only sync slicer.
=> Report lev filters are using filter the values in across the pages. => Sync slicer are filter across all pages.
=> performance wise filter is good.                                                        => Sync slicer is not good for performance.
=> It supports for measure.                                                                      => It doesn't support for measure.

Sync slicer: Synch slicer is nothing but it is feature of PBI. When this feature is used. In one page you put the filter and you can filter reports in other page that time we can use the one symbol and sinch the that page.
===============================================================================================================================================================================================
==>  What is the Bookmarks ?

 A: while Power BI Desktop does not have a hard storage limit, For larger datasets, utilizing Power BI Premium.
======================================================================================================================================================================================
==> Filter context and Row Context ?
A: Filter Context refers to the set of filters applied to the data model when a calculation is evaluated. 
    Ex: For instance, CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[Year] = 2020) changes the filter context to only include sales from the year 2020.
    
    Row context:it refers is the context that applies to the evaluated individual rows of a table.
     Ex: Sales[Total] = Sales[Quantity] * Sales[Price]
============================================================================================================================================================================

=================================================================================================================================================================================
==> What is Row Level Security and types of RLS?
A: Row level security is nothing but secure your data row level and with security filter based on create your roles.
     using manage roles button in modelling tab you can create roles based on Dax expression to control each role.
     once publish the web, you can assign users to each role.

   => Static RLS: When we have limited user when we have to see the limited values that time we can create static row level security.
   => Dynamic RLS: Suppose one user he wants to see the multiple states of sales 
        

======================================================================================================================================================================================

==> Difference between Caluclulated column and calculated measure?
A:                                                Measures                                                                                                                                                                                     Columns
==> It is uses due to the calculate the overall row.                                                                                                                     ==> IT is uses the calculated row by row and give the final value.
==> It is uses to find the calculator symbol is there.                                                                                                                   ==> it is uses the find out the summation symbol is there.
==> It is uses the When we create measure we can't see in a table.                                                                                       ==> It is uses the when we create column we can see the column in a table.
==> We can use slicers and filters the values.                                                                                                                              ==> it does not support for slicers.
==> Calculate based on row context.                                                                                                                                             ==> Calculate based on context.

==> Aggregate functions:  We can use measures only.

==> 1.Diff b/w Sum and SumX?

A: Sum: It is use the addition of the numbers in column.
      Ex: Sum = Sum('order'[Sales])

     SumX: It is uses the Evaluation of the Each row in a table and it gives each row in a table.
      Ex: SumX = SumX('orders','orders'[product]*'orders'[Quantity]).
	  
	 Count A= CountA('orders'[status]) 
	  
	 CountX: CountX(Filter('sales','sales'[status]=false(),'sales'[sales]) 
	  
	  A = Status[Boolean True or false], X = Filter function. 
	  
======================================================================================================================================================================
==> Text Functions: Columns only

5.Diff b/w value and Values?
A: Value: it is uses the that text string represents to the numbers.
     DAX: Currency vale = Value('order'[currency])
    
     Values: It is uses the return the unique values that is called values.
     DAX: Values = Values('order'[currency])
========================================================================================================================================================================
==> Logical functions: Columns

==> 2.Diff B/w IF and Switch?
Both we are using same functions. Sitch also using whenever we have multiple conditions that time we are writing nested if and switch function we are using.
A: If: This is uses the we are give one value and that is true otherwise written second value.
    Dax: If = IF('Prd1'[Sales]>3100,"True","False")
             
    Nested IF: It is uses the write one logic again write another logic.
	   DAX: Nested IF = IF('Prd1'[Address]="HYD","True",IF('Prd1'[Product]="BLR","False","Medium"))
       Dax: If=If('order'[Sub-category]="Chairs", "Furniture", If('order'[sub-category]="chairs", "Furniture", "Others")

==> How do you optimize sql queries in SQL Server
A: First When we working in large data sets that time we need see the carefully

  1. First we need to choose correct indexing like where,join,order by, group by they are improving query speed.
  2. Avoid over index like insert, update, delete.
  
  1. Most of the time aviod seelect * why bcz we need to write so many data retrived.
  2. as well as avioding where clause also why bcz that function also rewrite functions and store the more spaces.
  3. if it's possible use the inner join instead of outer join.why bcz we need only spl values.
  4. if it's possible we need to use temp tebles bcz it's increasing the query spped.
  5. regularly re building the indexes improve the performance.
  6. remove the unnesserly data.
  
  applying this techniques we need to optimize queries.
